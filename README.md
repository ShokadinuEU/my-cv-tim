I understood what gulp is and how amazing tool is for automation tasks like convert pug to css, scss to css or even minifying those files but the sad part is that i don't know how to do that with gulp and i really want to learn to "play" with it cus i think it can save alot of time when i write codes.

I like this method of using block to load the content, i am not that clear about this method particulary work "block" is this standing for a variable that store everuthing that is in it so we can use wherever we want or is something else even "cooler".
Great review on "playing" with variables to load the contend using each method.
